                <h5 class="code_1">Enhancement One:Software Design and Engineering</h5>
                    <p>
                     
                     During my code review process, I found several parts that needed enhancement. Firstly, I never considered putting any documentation in my java codes. According to java basic rules of coding, each class should contain a description that includes the name of the class its objectives, and the methods that are found in the class. Also, it further states that we should have our lines of code commented to help others understand our program. Therefore I will make sure all my classes and its methods have been commented and anyone can easily understand my program.
                        
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    
                    Secondly, I found several validation blocks in my program. These blocks used try-catch statements to throw exceptions in case some rules are violated, an example in a text field that requires a number receives a string. A number format exception should be thrown however this can be understood by a programmer, to a user a simple message to explain the mistake is required. This message block should be inserted in the catch block, therefore instead of printing the exception, the message will be displayed. In my application I used the same, however, I did not add any code on the catch block which makes it difficult to debug the program. I have corrected and enhanced my application on this part and all the catch parts in try-catch blocks have meaningful code that explains to the user or programmer the error that has occurred.This makes the project easy to debug and easy to read and understand.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    
                    <p>
                    Thirdly, an IF-ELSE statement without a default part can easily course logical errors. Itâ€™s strongly advised that whenever we use these IF-ELSE statement, we should put a default part. I came across same mistakes in my project, I also found a logical error which was coursed by the same mistake. These errors are difficult to find since cannot be detected by the compilers, I therefore took a step ahead to complete each IF-ELSE statement in my application.
                    
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                    Finally, according to java standard cording rules, all identifiers, class names, variable names, and method names should have descriptive names. Class names should start with capital letters. All variable names should be in small letters, except for constants. Further, for multiword method names, the first letter of the first word should be a small letter and for every other word, its first letter should be capitalized. I revised this part and all the classes, identifies and class names meet the coding standards of java.
                    
                    </p>
                   
                </li>
                  
                  
                  
                  <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                    
                 <h5 class="code_1">Achievement</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     The whole process of code review, though tiresome and requires a lot of time to identify all the mistakes in the project, it gave me a chance to make a deep research on java coding standards and software design. I am hence in a position to develop an application that is easy to read, update, debug, and also reliable to others. All the enhancements on this project concerning software design make the project more reliable and also can be easily debugged by other programmers.
                    
                 </p>

                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                    
                 <h5 class="code_1">Update</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     I managed to work on all the planned enhancement on this part of the project.
