                 <h5 class="code_1">Introduction</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     My “Report generator” application as the name suggest is a simple Java Desktop application developed using NetBeans IDE and SceneBuider.I used scenebuider to create and design the graphical user interphases while NetBeans was used to create the whole java project. The major objectives of the application is to manage and automate production of students examination report forms, manage and track students fee records and also automate students registration process in any small college.
                    
                </p>
                
                </li>
                  
                  
                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                 <h5 class="code_1">How It Works</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     The system requires all the details of the students in the college once that is done users can start recording student’s examination records for each semester and also track student’s fee records. The application is capable of producing only report forms of the students who cleared all the fee records for the semester, students with fee arrears will not have their report forms generated, this helps the examination and fees staff to track all students who have fees balances, the application has more features which automate the day to day college staffs.
                    
                </p>
                
                </li>
                  
                  
                 <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                 <h5 class="code_1">Fees Records</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     When it comes to fee records management, the application has a module that is meant to help the college to keep students fee records in an organized way. Once records have been recorded in the application, users can easily find students fee balances, can generate a report of all the students who cleared their fees for the current semester, report for all students who have fee balances by just a click of a button.
                    
                </p>
                
                </li>
                  
                  
                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                 <h5 class="code_1">Other</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     Furthermore, the application makes it possible to search for all types of information concerning a student easily and therefore saves a lot of time. Clean and neat reports are generated within no time and can be used by any person since it’s easy to use and does not require complicated devices, only a simple computer, and a printer.
                    
                </p>
                
                </li>
                  
                  
                  
                <li class="list-group-item" style="color: black">
                 <h5 class="code_1">Why I Chose This Project?</h5>
                 <p>
                     
                     After several classes on code review, I came to realize that before I perform a code review on another application, I should start with my own programs. This is among the applications I created and it had a lot to be enhanced on algorithm and data structures, Database, and the design part. That is the reason why I decided to choose this project. I believe these enhancements will make the application more reliable and powerful.
